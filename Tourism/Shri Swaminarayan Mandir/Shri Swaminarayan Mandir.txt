Shri Swaminarayan Mandir

Dedicated to the Hindu God, Narayan Akshardham Temple is known for its beautiful architecture, magnificent idols, sculptures, and carvings. The lush green surroundings add to its beauty and serenity.Most of his followers believe that Swaminarayan is the complete manifestation of Narayana or Purushottama Narayana - the Supreme Being and superior to other avatars. The belief of many followers that their founder was the incarnation of the Supreme God has also drawn criticism.
